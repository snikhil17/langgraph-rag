"""Represents an interrupt triggered by the graph that requires human intervention.

This is passed to the `interrupt` function when execution is paused for human input.

Attributes:
    action_request: The specific action being requested from the human
    config: Configuration defining what actions are allowed
    description: Optional detailed description of what input is needed

Example:
    ```python
    # Extract a tool call from the state and create an interrupt request
    request = HumanInterrupt(
        action_request=ActionRequest(
            action="run_command",  # The action being requested
            args={"command": "ls", "args": ["-l"]}  # Arguments for the action

        config=HumanInterruptConfig(
            allow_ignore=True,    # Allow skipping this step
            allow_respond=True,   # Allow text feedback
            allow_edit=False,     # Don't allow editing
