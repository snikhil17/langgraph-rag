       " Document(metadata={'source': 'adk_documentation_website_data/adk-docs_agents.html', 'source_path': 'adk_documentation_website_data/adk-docs_agents.html'}, page_content=\"Agents¶\\n\\nIn the Agent Development Kit (ADK), an Agent is a self-contained execution unit designed to act autonomously to achieve specific goals. Agents can perform tasks, interact with users, utilize external tools, and coordinate with other agents.\\n\\nThe foundation for all agents in ADK is the BaseAgent class. It serves as the fundamental blueprint. To create functional agents, you typically extend BaseAgent in one of three main ways, catering to different needs – from intelligent reasoning to structured process control.\\n\\nTypes of agents in ADK\\n\\nCore Agent Categories¶\\n\\nADK provides distinct agent categories to build sophisticated applications:\\n\\nLLM Agents (LlmAgent, Agent): These agents utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) as their core engine to understand natural language, reason, plan, generate responses, and dynamically decide how to proceed or which tools to use, making them ideal for flexible, language-centric tasks. Learn more about LLM Agents...\\n\\nWorkflow Agents (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent): These specialized agents control the execution flow of other agents in predefined, deterministic patterns (sequence, parallel, or loop) without using an LLM for the flow control itself, perfect for structured processes needing predictable execution. Explore Workflow Agents...\\n\\nCustom Agents: Created by extending BaseAgent directly, these agents allow you to implement unique operational logic, specific control flows, or specialized integrations not covered by the standard types, catering to highly tailored application requirements. Discover how to build Custom Agents...\\n\\nChoosing the Right Agent Type¶\\n\\nThe following table provides a high-level comparison to help distinguish between the agent types. As you explore each type in more detail in the subsequent sections, these distinctions will become clearer.\\n\\nFeature LLM Agent ( LlmAgent ) Workflow Agent Custom Agent ( BaseAgent subclass) Primary Function Reasoning, Generation, Tool Use Controlling Agent Execution Flow Implementing Unique Logic/Integrations Core Engine Large Language Model (LLM) Predefined Logic (Sequence, Parallel, Loop) Custom Python Code Determinism Non-deterministic (Flexible) Deterministic (Predictable) Can be either, based on implementation Primary Use Language tasks, Dynamic decisions Structured processes, Orchestration Tailored requirements, Specific workflows\\n\\nAgents Working Together: Multi-Agent Systems¶\\n\\nWhile each agent type serves a distinct purpose, the true power often comes from combining them. Complex applications frequently employ multi-agent architectures where:\\n\\nLLM Agents handle intelligent, language-based task execution.\\n\\nWorkflow Agents manage the overall process flow using standard patterns.\\n\\nCustom Agents provide specialized capabilities or rules needed for unique integrations.\\n\\nUnderstanding these core types is the first step toward building sophisticated, capable AI applications with ADK.\\n\\nWhat's Next?¶\\n\\nNow that you have an overview of the different agent types available in ADK, dive deeper into how they work and how to use them effectively:\\n\\nLLM Agents: Explore how to configure agents powered by large language models, including setting instructions, providing tools, and enabling advanced features like planning and code execution.\\n\\nWorkflow Agents: Learn how to orchestrate tasks using SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, and LoopAgent for structured and predictable processes.\\n\\nCustom Agents: Discover the principles of extending BaseAgent to build agents with unique logic and integrations tailored to your specific needs.\\n\\nMulti-Agents: Understand how to combine different agent types to create sophisticated, collaborative systems capable of tackling complex problems.\\n\\nModels: Learn about the different LLM integrations available and how to select the right model for your agents.\")]"

From the document, I see that custom agents offer a lot of flexibility beyond the standard Sequential, Loop, and Parallel agents. The key part I'm focusing on is the chunk provided, which talks about the _run_async_impl method and its capabilities.\\n\\nFirst, I need to grasp what _run_async_impl does. It's an async function that returns an AsyncGenerator of events. This means it can yield events from sub-agents as they happen. The method takes an InvocationContext, which provides runtime information, especially the session state. The session state is crucial because it's how data is passed between different steps in the workflow.\\n\\nThe chunk explains that within _run_async_impl, you can call sub-agents using their run_async method. Each sub-agent's events are yielded, allowing the custom agent to process or log them as needed. This makes sense because it allows the custom agent to handle each event in real-time.\\n\\nManaging state is another important aspect. The session state is a dictionary where data can be stored and retrieved. For example, after a sub-agent runs, it might store its result in the state under a specific key. The custom agent can then read this key to make decisions, like choosing which sub-agent to call next. This is particularly useful for conditional logic, where the flow depends on the outcome of previous steps.\\n\\nThe chunk also mentions implementing control flow using standard Python constructs. This means I can use if statements, loops, and exception handling to create complex workflows. For example, if a certain condition in the state is met, the custom agent can call one sub-agent; otherwise, it calls another. This flexibility is powerful because it allows the agent to adapt dynamically based on runtime data.\\n\\nAnother point is managing sub-agents. The custom agent typically orchestrates other agents, which are passed during initialization and stored as instance attributes. When initializing the BaseAgent, it's important to include these sub-agents in the sub_agents list so the framework knows about them. This is necessary for lifecycle management and other framework features.\\n\\nI'm a bit confused about how the sub_agents list works. If I have a custom agent that uses a LoopAgent, which in turn uses other agents, do I need to list all of them in the sub_agents list, or just the top-level ones? The document says that the sub_agents list should include the agents directly orchestrated by the custom agent, so I think only the top-level ones need to be listed.\\n\\nI also wonder about error handling. Since _run_async_impl is an async generator, how do I handle exceptions that might occur when calling sub-agents? The chunk mentions using try/except blocks, which makes sense. I should wrap the async for loop in a try block to catch any exceptions and handle them appropriately, maybe by logging an error and stopping the workflow.\\n\\nAnother thing I'm thinking about is how to test this. Since the custom agent's behavior depends on the state, I need to ensure that each sub-agent correctly updates the state and that the custom agent reads it properly. Maybe I can write unit tests that simulate different state scenarios and check if the custom agent responds as expected.\\n\\nI'm also curious about best practices for structuring the _run_async_impl method. Should I break it down into smaller helper methods, or keep it as a single block? It might be better to keep it as a single method for simplicity unless the logic becomes too complex, in which case breaking it into helper methods would improve readability.\\n\\nLastly, I'm thinking about how to integrate external services. The document mentions that custom agents can call external APIs or databases. I need to make sure that any such calls are properly awaited and that errors are handled. Also, I should consider performance implications, like making sure that external calls don't block the event loop.\\n\\nOverall, building a custom agent seems manageable as long as I carefully manage the state, correctly handle async operations, and structure the code for readability and maintainability.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo build a custom agent in ADK by implementing `_run_async_impl`, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Inherit from BaseAgent**: Create a class that inherits from `BaseAgent` and implement the `_run_async_impl` method.\\n\\n2. **Async Generator**: Define `_run_async_impl` as an async function that returns an `AsyncGenerator[Event, None]`. This allows yielding events from sub-agents as they occur.\\n\\n3. **Invocation Context**: Use the `ctx` parameter to access runtime information, particularly `ctx.session.state` for sharing data between steps.\\n\\n4. **Call Sub-Agents**: Invoke sub-agents using their `run_async` method within an `async for` loop. Yield each event to process or log them as needed.\\n\\n5. **State Management**: Read from and write to `ctx.session.state` to pass data between sub-agents and make decisions based on previous results.\\n\\n6. **Control Flow**: Use Python constructs like `if` statements, loops, and exception handling to create conditional or iterative workflows.\\n\\n7. **Sub-Agent Management**: Initialize sub-agents in the `__init__` method, store them as instance attributes, and include top-level sub-agents in the `sub_agents` list passed to `super().__init__`.\\n\\n8. **Error Handling**: Use `try/except` blocks within the `async for` loop to catch and handle exceptions, ensuring the workflow can recover or terminate gracefully.\\n\\n9. **Testing**: Simulate different state scenarios in unit tests to verify the custom agent behaves as expected.\\n\\n10. **Code Structure**: Keep `_run_async_impl` concise; consider helper methods if the logic becomes complex.\\n\\n11. **External Integrations**: Ensure external API or database calls are properly awaited and handle potential performance implications.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can create a custom agent that orchestrates complex workflows with dynamic behavior based on runtime conditions.\"}, page_content='<think>\\nOkay, so I\\'m trying to understand how to build a custom agent in ADK by implementing _run_async_impl.

The document mentions that custom agents can call external APIs or databases. I need to make sure that any such calls are properly awaited and that errors are handled. Also, I should consider performance implications, like making sure that external calls don\\'t block the event loop.\\n\\nOverall, building a custom agent seems manageable as long as I carefully manage the state, correctly handle async operations, and structure the code for readability and maintainability.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo build a custom agent in ADK by implementing `_run_async_impl`, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Inherit from BaseAgent**: Create a class that inherits from `BaseAgent` and implement the `_run_async_impl` method.\\n\\n2. **Async Generator**: Define `_run_async_impl` as an async function that returns an `AsyncGenerator[Event, None]`. This allows yielding events from sub-agents as they occur.\\n\\n3. **Invocation Context**: Use the `ctx` parameter to access runtime information, particularly `ctx.session.state` for sharing data between steps.\\n\\n4. **Call Sub-Agents**: Invoke sub-agents using their `run_async` method within an `async for` loop. Yield each event to process or log them as needed.\\n\\n5. **State Management**: Read from and write to `ctx.session.state` to pass data between sub-agents and make decisions based on previous results.\\n\\n6. **Control Flow**: Use Python constructs like `if` statements, loops, and exception handling to create conditional or iterative workflows.\\n\\n7. **Sub-Agent Management**: Initialize sub-agents in the `__init__` method, store them as instance attributes, and include top-level sub-agents in the `sub_agents` list passed to `super().__init__`.\\n\\n8. **Error Handling**: Use `try/except` blocks within the `async for` loop to catch and handle exceptions, ensuring the workflow can recover or terminate gracefully.\\n\\n9. **Testing**: Simulate different state scenarios in unit tests to verify the custom agent behaves as expected.\\n\\n10. **Code Structure**: Keep `_run_async_impl` concise; consider helper methods if the logic becomes complex.\\n\\n11. **External Integrations**: Ensure external API or database calls are properly awaited and handle potential performance implications.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can create a custom agent that orchestrates complex workflows with dynamic behavior based on runtime conditions.\\n\\nctx (InvocationContext): Provides access to crucial runtime information, most importantly ctx.session.state, which is the primary way to share data between steps orchestrated by your custom agent.\\n\\nKey Capabilities within _run_async_impl:\\n\\nCalling Sub-Agents: You invoke sub-agents (which are typically stored as instance attributes like self.my_llm_agent) using their run_async method and yield their events:\\n\\nasync for event in self.some_sub_agent.run_async(ctx):\\n    # Optionally inspect or log the event\\n    yield event # Pass the event up\\n\\nManaging State: Read from and write to the session state dictionary (ctx.session.state) to pass data between sub-agent calls or make decisions:\\n\\n# Read data set by a previous agent\\nprevious_result = ctx.session.state.get(\"some_key\")\\n\\n# Make a decision based on state\\nif previous_result == \"some_value\":\\n    # ... call a specific sub-agent ...\\nelse:\\n    # ... call another sub-agent ...\\n\\n# Store a result for a later step (often done via a sub-agent\\'s output_key)\\n# ctx.session.state[\"my_custom_result\"] = \"calculated_value\"\\n\\nImplementing Control Flow: Use standard Python constructs (if/elif/else, for/while loops, try/except) to create sophisticated, conditional, or iterative workflows involving your sub-agents.\\n\\nManaging Sub-Agents and State¶\\n\\nTypically, a custom agent orchestrates other agents (like LlmAgent, LoopAgent, etc.).'),\n",

This makes them accessible within _run_async_impl.\\n\\nsub_agents List: When initializing the BaseAgent using super().__init__(...), you should pass a sub_agents list. This list tells the ADK framework about the agents that are part of this custom agent's immediate hierarchy.

This makes me think that the provided chunk is part of a larger section on Gemini models specifically.\\n\\nI\\'m not entirely sure how the environment variables like GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE affect the model usage. It seems like it tells the library to use Vertex AI instead of Google AI Studio. The examples then use model strings like \"gemini-2.0-flash\" directly in the LlmAgent, which probably pulls the correct model from Vertex AI.\\n\\nI\\'m also curious about the model identifiers. The examples use \"gemini-2.0-flash\" and \"gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25\". I suppose these are specific versions available on Vertex AI, and the user needs to check the latest model IDs from the documentation.\\n\\nOverall, the chunk is about configuring ADK to use Gemini models via Vertex AI, including authentication, environment setup, and example agents. It\\'s part of a guide that also covers other models and methods, but this specific part is focused on Gemini on Vertex AI.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe provided chunk is part of a section detailing how to integrate Google Gemini models using Vertex AI within the ADK, including setup steps and example configurations.\\n\\nSetup:\\n\\nAuthenticate using Application Default Credentials (ADC):\\n\\ngcloud auth application-default login\\n\\nSet your Google Cloud project and location:\\n\\nexport GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=\"YOUR_PROJECT_ID\"\\nexport GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=\"YOUR_VERTEX_AI_LOCATION\" # e.g., us-central1\\n\\nExplicitly tell the library to use Vertex AI:\\n\\nexport GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=TRUE\\n\\nModels: Find available model IDs in the Vertex AI documentation.\\n\\nExample:\\n\\nfrom google.adk.agents import LlmAgent\\n\\n# --- Example using a stable Gemini Flash model ---\\nagent_gemini_flash = LlmAgent(\\n    # Use the latest stable Flash model identifier\\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\\n    name=\"gemini_flash_agent\",\\n    instruction=\"You are a fast and helpful Gemini assistant.\",\\n    # ... other agent parameters\\n)\\n\\n# --- Example using a powerful Gemini Pro model ---\\n# Note: Always check the official Gemini documentation for the latest model names,\\n# including specific preview versions if needed.

The Agent Development Kit (ADK) supports building sophisticated applications by composing multiple, distinct BaseAgent instances into a Multi-Agent System (MAS).\\n\\nIn ADK, a multi-agent system is an application where different agents, often forming a hierarchy, collaborate or coordinate to achieve a larger goal. Structuring your application this way offers significant advantages, including enhanced modularity, specialization, reusability, maintainability, and the ability to define structured control flows using dedicated workflow agents.\\n\\nYou can compose various types of agents derived from BaseAgent to build these systems:\\n\\nLLM Agents: Agents powered by large language models. (See LLM Agents)\\n\\nWorkflow Agents: Specialized agents (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent) designed to manage the execution flow of their sub-agents. (See Workflow Agents)\\n\\nCustom agents: Your own agents inheriting from BaseAgent with specialized, non-LLM logic. (See Custom Agents)\\n\\nThe following sections detail the core ADK primitives—such as agent hierarchy, workflow agents, and interaction mechanisms—that enable you to construct and manage these multi-agent systems effectively.\\n\\n2.

ADK Primitives for Agent Composition¶\\n\\nADK provides core building blocks—primitives—that enable you to structure and manage interactions within your multi-agent system.\\n\\n2.1. Agent Hierarchy (parent_agent, sub_agents)¶\\n\\nThe foundation for structuring multi-agent systems is the parent-child relationship defined in BaseAgent.\\n\\nEstablishing Hierarchy: You create a tree structure by passing a list of agent instances to the sub_agents argument when initializing a parent agent. ADK automatically sets the parent_agent attribute on each child agent during initialization (google.adk.agents.base_agent.py - model_post_init).\\n\\nSingle Parent Rule: An agent instance can only be added as a sub-agent once. Attempting to assign a second parent will result in a ValueError.\\n\\nImportance: This hierarchy defines the scope for Workflow Agents and influences the potential targets for LLM-Driven Delegation. You can navigate the hierarchy using agent.parent_agent or find descendants using agent.find_agent(name).\\n\\n# Conceptual Example: Defining Hierarchy\\nfrom google.adk.agents import LlmAgent, BaseAgent\\n\\n# Define individual agents\\ngreeter = LlmAgent(name=\"Greeter\", model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\")\\ntask_doer = BaseAgent(name=\"TaskExecutor\") # Custom non-LLM agent'),\n",

Workflow Agents as Orchestrators¶\\n\\nADK includes specialized agents derived from BaseAgent that don\\'t perform tasks themselves but orchestrate the execution flow of their sub_agents.\\n\\nSequentialAgent: Executes its sub_agents one after another in the order they are listed.\\n\\nContext: Passes the same InvocationContext sequentially, allowing agents to easily pass results via shared state.\\n\\n# Conceptual Example: Sequential Pipeline\\nfrom google.adk.agents import SequentialAgent, LlmAgent\\n\\nstep1 = LlmAgent(name=\"Step1_Fetch\", output_key=\"data\") # Saves output to state[\\'data\\']\\nstep2 = LlmAgent(name=\"Step2_Process\", instruction=\"Process data from state key \\'data\\'.\")\\n\\npipeline = SequentialAgent(name=\"MyPipeline\", sub_agents=[step1, step2])\\n# When pipeline runs, Step2 can access the state[\\'data\\'] set by Step1.'),\n",

They determine the execution sequence according to their type (e.g., sequential, parallel, loop) without consulting an LLM for the orchestration itself. This results in deterministic and predictable execution patterns.\\n\\nADK provides three core workflow agent types, each implementing a distinct execution pattern:\\n\\nSequential Agents\\n\\nExecutes sub-agents one after another, in sequence.\\n\\nLearn more\\n\\nLoop Agents\\n\\nRepeatedly executes its sub-agents until a specific termination condition is met.\\n\\nLearn more\\n\\nParallel Agents\\n\\nExecutes multiple sub-agents in parallel.\\n\\nLearn more\\n\\nWhy Use Workflow Agents?¶\\n\\nWorkflow agents are essential when you need explicit control over how a series of tasks or agents are executed.

It repeatedly runs a sequence of agents for a specified number of iterations or until a termination condition is met.\\n\\nUse the LoopAgent when your workflow involves repetition or iterative refinement, such as like revising code.\\n\\nExample¶\\n\\nYou want to build an agent that can generate images of food, but sometimes when you want to generate a specific number of items (e.g. 5 bananas), it generates a different number of those items in the image (e.g. an image of 7 bananas). You have two tools: generate_image, count_food_items. Because you want to keep generating images until it either correctly generates the specified number of items, or after a certain number of iterations, you should build your agent using a LoopAgent.\\n\\nAs with other workflow agents, the LoopAgent is not powered by an LLM, and is thus deterministic in how it executes. That being said, workflow agents are only concerned only with their execution (i.e. in a loop), and not their internal logic; the tools or sub-agents of a workflow agent may or may not utilize LLMs.\\n\\nHow it Works¶\\n\\nWhen the LoopAgent's run_async() method is called, it performs the following actions:\\n\\nSub-Agent Execution: It iterates through the sub_agents list in order.

You must implement a termination mechanism to prevent infinite loops. Common strategies include:\\n\\nmax_iterations: Set a maximum number of iterations in the LoopAgent. The loop will terminate after that many iterations.\\n\\nEscalation from sub-agent: Design one or more sub-agents to evaluate a condition (e.g., \"Is the document quality good enough?\", \"Has a consensus been reached?\"). If the condition is met, the sub-agent can signal termination (e.g., by raising a custom event, setting a flag in a shared context, or returning a specific value).\\n\\nLoop Agent\\n\\nFull Example: Iterative Document Improvement¶\\n\\nImagine a scenario where you want to iteratively improve a document:\\n\\nWriter Agent: An LlmAgent that generates or refines a draft on a topic.\\n\\nCritic Agent: An LlmAgent that critiques the draft, identifying areas for improvement.\\n\\nLoopAgent(sub_agents=[WriterAgent, CriticAgent], max_iterations=5)'),\n",

They allow your agents and tools to handle data beyond simple text strings, enabling richer interactions involving files, images, audio, and other binary formats.\\n\\nWhat are Artifacts?¶\\n\\nDefinition: An Artifact is essentially a piece of binary data (like the content of a file) identified by a unique filename string within a specific scope (session or user).

They allow you to observe, customize, and even control the agent's behavior at specific, predefined points without modifying the core ADK framework code.\\n\\nWhat are they? In essence, callbacks are standard Python functions that you define. You then associate these functions with an agent when you create it. The ADK framework automatically calls your functions at key stages, letting you observe or intervene.

From the document, I see that callbacks are functions that can be attached to an agent to modify its behavior at specific points. The chunk I\\'m looking at explains why callbacks are useful and how to add them.\\n\\nFirst, the reasons for using callbacks are listed: observe and debug, customize and control, implement guardrails, manage state, and integrate or enhance functionality. These all seem like important use cases. Then, it shows how to register a callback by defining a function and passing it to the agent\\'s constructor.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused about how the context objects work. The function takes a CallbackContext and an LlmRequest. I think the CallbackContext provides information about the agent\\'s state, but I\\'m not entirely sure how to use it. Also, the function can return an LlmResponse or None. Returning None allows the agent to proceed normally, while returning an LlmResponse would skip the model call.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to think of a practical example. Suppose I want to log every time the agent is about to call the LLM. I would define a function that prints some information and returns None. If I want to prevent the agent from calling the LLM under certain conditions, I could return a predefined LlmResponse.\\n\\nI\\'m also wondering about the parameters. The function is defined with callback_context and llm_request. How do I access the agent\\'s name or other session details from the callback_context? Maybe there\\'s a method or attribute in CallbackContext that provides that information.\\n\\nAnother thing I\\'m not clear on is the difference between before_agent, before_model, and before_tool callbacks. I think before_agent is called before the agent starts processing a request, before_model before calling the LLM, and before_tool before executing a tool. Each allows intervention at different stages.\\n\\nI should probably look up the CallbackContext class to understand what methods and attributes it has.

From the document, I see that callbacks are functions that can be attached to an agent to modify its behavior at specific points. The chunk I\\'m looking at explains why callbacks are useful and how to add them.\\n\\nFirst, the reasons for using callbacks are listed: observe and debug, customize and control, implement guardrails, manage state, and integrate or enhance functionality. These all seem like important use cases. Then, it shows how to register a callback by defining a function and passing it to the agent\\'s constructor.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused about how the context objects work. The function takes a CallbackContext and an LlmRequest. I think the CallbackContext provides information about the agent\\'s state, but I\\'m not entirely sure how to use it. Also, the function can return an LlmResponse or None. Returning None allows the agent to proceed normally, while returning an LlmResponse would skip the model call.\\n\\nI\\'m trying to think of a practical example. Suppose I want to log every time the agent is about to call the LLM. I would define a function that prints some information and returns None. If I want to prevent the agent from calling the LLM under certain conditions, I could return a predefined LlmResponse.\\n\\nI\\'m also wondering about the parameters. The function is defined with callback_context and llm_request. How do I access the agent\\'s name or other session details from the callback_context? Maybe there\\'s a method or attribute in CallbackContext that provides that information.\\n\\nAnother thing I\\'m not clear on is the difference between before_agent, before_model, and before_tool callbacks. I think before_agent is called before the agent starts processing a request, before_model before calling the LLM, and before_tool before executing a tool. Each allows intervention at different stages.\\n\\nI should probably look up the CallbackContext class to understand what methods and attributes it has. That would help me know what information I can access and how I can interact with the agent\\'s state.\\n\\nOverall, I think I get the basic idea: define a function, pass it to the agent, and use it to modify behavior.

I remember reading about design patterns and best practices for callbacks, but I'm a bit confused about where to start. Let me see if I can break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I think callbacks are like hooks that let me intercept and modify the flow of the agent. There are different types like before_model_callback and after_tool_callback. Each of these must serve a specific purpose. I remember something about guardrails and policy enforcement. So, maybe I can use a before_model_callback to check if the request contains forbidden keywords and block it if necessary.\\n\\nThen there's dynamic state management. I guess that means I can store and retrieve data between different steps of the agent's execution. For example, if I get a transaction ID from a tool, I can save it in the state so another part of the agent can use it later. That makes the agent more context-aware, which is pretty cool.\\n\\nLogging and monitoring also seem important. I can add logs at various points to track what's happening. Maybe log when a tool is about to run or after it finishes. That would help with debugging if something goes wrong.\\n\\nCaching is another pattern I saw. If I'm making the same requests repeatedly, I can cache the results to save time and resources. So, in a before_tool_callback, I can check if the result is already cached and return it immediately instead of making the actual call. Then, after the tool runs, I can store the result in the cache for next time.\\n\\nRequest and response modification is useful too. I can tweak the data before sending it to the LLM or tool, or modify the response after receiving it. For example, adding system instructions based on the user's language preference.\\n\\nConditional skipping of steps is interesting. If certain conditions are met, I can skip calling the LLM or a tool entirely. That could prevent unnecessary processing or handle cases where an API quota is exceeded.\\n\\nTool-specific actions like authentication and controlling summarization are a bit tricky.

I remember reading about design patterns and best practices for callbacks, but I\\'m a bit confused about where to start. Let me see if I can break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I think callbacks are like hooks that let me intercept and modify the flow of the agent. There are different types like before_model_callback and after_tool_callback. Each of these must serve a specific purpose. I remember something about guardrails and policy enforcement. So, maybe I can use a before_model_callback to check if the request contains forbidden keywords and block it if necessary.\\n\\nThen there\\'s dynamic state management. I guess that means I can store and retrieve data between different steps of the agent\\'s execution. For example, if I get a transaction ID from a tool, I can save it in the state so another part of the agent can use it later. That makes the agent more context-aware, which is pretty cool.\\n\\nLogging and monitoring also seem important. I can add logs at various points to track what\\'s happening. Maybe log when a tool is about to run or after it finishes. That would help with debugging if something goes wrong.\\n\\nCaching is another pattern I saw. If I\\'m making the same requests repeatedly, I can cache the results to save time and resources. So, in a before_tool_callback, I can check if the result is already cached and return it immediately instead of making the actual call. Then, after the tool runs, I can store the result in the cache for next time.\\n\\nRequest and response modification is useful too. I can tweak the data before sending it to the LLM or tool, or modify the response after receiving it. For example, adding system instructions based on the user\\'s language preference.\\n\\nConditional skipping of steps is interesting. If certain conditions are met, I can skip calling the LLM or a tool entirely. That could prevent unnecessary processing or handle cases where an API quota is exceeded.\\n\\nTool-specific actions like authentication and controlling summarization are a bit tricky. I need to make sure the tool has the right credentials and maybe bypass summarization if the tool returns structured data that the LLM doesn\\'t need to process.\\n\\nHandling artifacts is something I hadn\\'t thought about. I can save files or data during the agent\\'s execution and load them when needed. That could be useful for reports or configurations.\\n\\nBest practices are crucial. I should keep each callback focused on one task to avoid making them too complex. Performance is a concern too; I don\\'t want my callbacks to slow down the agent.

This should help me create a more robust and efficient agent using ADK.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe chunk discusses various design patterns for using callbacks in ADK, including caching, request/response modification, conditional step skipping, and tool-specific actions, providing examples and explanations for each pattern.\\n\\nExample: before_tool_callback for get_stock_price(symbol) checks state[f\"cache:stock:{symbol}\"]. If present, returns the cached price; otherwise, allows the API call and after_tool_callback saves the result to the state key.\\n\\n5. Request/Response Modification¶\\n\\nPattern: Alter data just before it\\'s sent to the LLM/tool or just after it\\'s received.\\n\\nHow:\\n\\nbefore_model_callback: Modify llm_request (e.g., add system instructions based on state).\\n\\nafter_model_callback: Modify the returned LlmResponse (e.g., format text, filter content).\\n\\nbefore_tool_callback: Modify the tool args dictionary.\\n\\nafter_tool_callback: Modify the tool_response dictionary.\\n\\nExample: before_model_callback appends \"User language preference: Spanish\" to llm_request.config.system_instruction if context.state[\\'lang\\'] == \\'es\\'.\\n\\n6. Conditional Skipping of Steps¶\\n\\nPattern: Prevent standard operations (agent run, LLM call, tool execution) based on certain conditions.\\n\\nHow: Return a value from a before_ callback (Content from before_agent_callback, LlmResponse from before_model_callback, dict from before_tool_callback). The framework interprets this returned value as the result for that step, skipping the normal execution.\\n\\nExample: before_tool_callback checks tool_context.state[\\'api_quota_exceeded\\']. If True, it returns {\\'error\\': \\'API quota exceeded\\'}, preventing the actual tool function from running.\\n\\n7. Tool-Specific Actions (Authentication & Summarization Control)¶'),\n",

If True, it returns {'error': 'API quota exceeded'}, preventing the actual tool function from running.\\n\\n7. Tool-Specific Actions (Authentication & Summarization Control)¶\\n\\nPattern: Handle actions specific to the tool lifecycle, primarily authentication and controlling LLM summarization of tool results.\\n\\nHow: Use ToolContext within tool callbacks (before_tool_callback, after_tool_callback).\\n\\nAuthentication: Call tool_context.request_credential(auth_config) in before_tool_callback if credentials are required but not found (e.g., via tool_context.get_auth_response or state check). This initiates the auth flow.\\n\\nSummarization: Set tool_context.actions.skip_summarization = True if the raw dictionary output of the tool should be passed back to the LLM or potentially displayed directly, bypassing the default LLM summarization step.\\n\\nExample: A before_tool_callback for a secure API checks for an auth token in state; if missing, it calls request_credential. An after_tool_callback for a tool returning structured JSON might set skip_summarization = True.\\n\\n8.

Artifact Handling¶\\n\\nPattern: Save or load session-related files or large data blobs during the agent lifecycle.\\n\\nHow: Use callback_context.save_artifact / tool_context.save_artifact to store data (e.g., generated reports, logs, intermediate data). Use load_artifact to retrieve previously stored artifacts.

A before_agent_callback might load a configuration artifact using callback_context.load_artifact(\"agent_config.json\").\\n\\nBest Practices for Callbacks¶\\n\\nKeep Focused: Design each callback for a single, well-defined purpose (e.g., just logging, just validation). Avoid monolithic callbacks.\\n\\nMind Performance: Callbacks execute synchronously within the agent\\'s processing loop. Avoid long-running or blocking operations (network calls, heavy computation). Offload if necessary, but be aware this adds complexity.\\n\\nHandle Errors Gracefully: Use try...except blocks within your callback functions. Log errors appropriately and decide if the agent invocation should halt or attempt recovery.

Let me go through the steps one by one to make sure I understand everything correctly.\\n\\nFirst, I see that there are two methods: using the adk deploy cloud_run command and using the gcloud run deploy command. I'm more familiar with the gcloud CLI, so I think I'll go with that method. Plus, it seems like it gives me more control over the setup.\\n\\nI need to set up my project structure properly. The document mentions that I should have a directory called capital_agent with __init__.py and agent.py. I also need main.py, requirements.txt, and a Dockerfile in the root directory. Let me check if I have all these files. I have agent.py and __init__.py in the capital_agent folder. Now, I need to create main.py, requirements.txt, and Dockerfile in the root.\\n\\nLooking at the main.py example, it imports get_fast_api_app from google.adk.cli.fast_api. I need to make sure I have the correct imports and that the agent directory is correctly specified. I'll set AGENT_DIR to the current directory since main.py is in the root. The SESSION_DB_URL is set to SQLite, which is fine for testing. I'll also set ALLOWED_ORIGINS to include localhost and any other necessary domains. Since I might want to test the UI, I'll set SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE to True.\\n\\nNext, the requirements.txt file lists google_adk and any other dependencies. I'll make sure to include all the packages my agent needs, like any specific libraries or versions.\\n\\nThe Dockerfile seems straightforward. It uses Python 3.13-slim as the base image, sets up the working directory, copies requirements.txt, installs dependencies, and then copies the rest of the application. It also sets up a non-root user for security, which is a good practice. The CMD runs uvicorn with the main app on port 8080, but I notice it uses $PORT, so I should make sure that the environment variable is correctly handled in Cloud Run.\\n\\nNow, I need to set my environment variables. I'll export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION, and GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI. I'll replace the placeholders with my actual project ID and set the location to us-central1 as suggested.\\n\\nFor deployment, I'll use the gcloud run deploy command. I'll navigate to my project directory in the terminal and run the command with the necessary flags. I'll include --allow-unauthenticated to make the service publicly accessible for testing. I'll also set the environment variables using --set-env-vars. I need to make sure all the variables my agent requires are included here.\\n\\nAfter deployment, I'll get a service URL. I can test the UI by navigating to that URL in my browser. If I encounter any issues, I'll check the Cloud Run console logs for errors.\\n\\nFor API testing, I'll use curl commands. I'll get an identity token if my service requires authentication, but since I used --allow-unauthenticated, I can skip the token for now. I'll test listing available apps, creating a session, and running the agent with a sample prompt to see if everything works as expected.\\n\\nI think I've covered all the steps. I just need to make sure all the files are correctly set up and that I've replaced placeholders with my actual project details.

The SESSION_DB_URL is set to SQLite, which is fine for testing. I\\'ll also set ALLOWED_ORIGINS to include localhost and any other necessary domains. Since I might want to test the UI, I\\'ll set SERVE_WEB_INTERFACE to True.\\n\\nNext, the requirements.txt file lists google_adk and any other dependencies. I\\'ll make sure to include all the packages my agent needs, like any specific libraries or versions.\\n\\nThe Dockerfile seems straightforward. It uses Python 3.13-slim as the base image, sets up the working directory, copies requirements.txt, installs dependencies, and then copies the rest of the application. It also sets up a non-root user for security, which is a good practice. The CMD runs uvicorn with the main app on port 8080, but I notice it uses $PORT, so I should make sure that the environment variable is correctly handled in Cloud Run.\\n\\nNow, I need to set my environment variables. I\\'ll export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT, GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION, and GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI. I\\'ll replace the placeholders with my actual project ID and set the location to us-central1 as suggested.\\n\\nFor deployment, I\\'ll use the gcloud run deploy command. I\\'ll navigate to my project directory in the terminal and run the command with the necessary flags. I\\'ll include --allow-unauthenticated to make the service publicly accessible for testing. I\\'ll also set the environment variables using --set-env-vars. I need to make sure all the variables my agent requires are included here.\\n\\nAfter deployment, I\\'ll get a service URL. I can test the UI by navigating to that URL in my browser. If I encounter any issues, I\\'ll check the Cloud Run console logs for errors.\\n\\nFor API testing, I\\'ll use curl commands. I\\'ll get an identity token if my service requires authentication, but since I used --allow-unauthenticated, I can skip the token for now. I\\'ll test listing available apps, creating a session, and running the agent with a sample prompt to see if everything works as expected.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve covered all the steps. I just need to make sure all the files are correctly set up and that I\\'ve replaced placeholders with my actual project details. If I run into any problems, I\\'ll refer back to the documentation or check the logs for more information.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo deploy an agent to Google Cloud Run using the gcloud CLI, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Set Up Project Structure**:\\n   - Create a directory named `capital_agent` containing `agent.py` and `__init__.py`.\\n   - In the root directory, create `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `Dockerfile`.\\n\\n2. **Configure `main.py`**:\\n   - Import necessary modules and set up the FastAPI app using `get_fast_api_app`.\\n   - Specify the agent directory, session database URL, allowed origins, and whether to serve the web interface.\\n\\n3. **Define Dependencies in `requirements.txt`**:\\n   - List all Python packages required by your agent, including `google_adk`.\\n\\n4. **Set Up `Dockerfile`**:\\n   - Use a base Python image, install dependencies, and configure the container to run the FastAPI app.\\n\\n5. **Set Environment Variables**:\\n   - Export `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`.\\n\\n6. **Deploy Using `gcloud run deploy`**:\\n   - Navigate to your project directory and execute the deployment command with necessary flags, including `--allow-unauthenticated` for public access.\\n\\n7. **Test the Deployment**:\\n   - Use the provided service URL to access the UI or test API endpoints with `curl` commands to interact with your agent.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can successfully deploy your agent to Cloud Run and test its functionality.\\n\\nexport TOKEN=$(gcloud auth print-identity-token)\\n\\nIf your service allows unauthenticated access, you can omit the -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" header from the curl commands below.\\n\\nList available apps¶\\n\\nVerify the deployed application name.\\n\\ncurl -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" $APP_URL/list-apps\\n\\n(Adjust the app_name in the following commands based on this output if needed. The default is often the agent directory name, e.g., capital_agent).\\n\\nCreate or Update a Session¶\\n\\nInitialize or update the state for a specific user and session. Replace capital_agent with your actual app name if different.

We can compare that against the list of steps we expect the agent to have taken.\\n\\nEvaluating trajectory and tool use¶\\n\\nBefore responding to a user, an agent typically performs a series of actions, which we refer to as a \\'trajectory.\\' It might compare the user input with session history to disambiguate a term, or lookup a policy document, search a knowledge base or invoke an API to save a ticket. We call this a ‘trajectory’ of actions. Evaluating an agent\\'s performance requires comparing its actual trajectory to an expected, or ideal, one. This comparison can reveal errors and inefficiencies in the agent\\'s process. The expected trajectory represents the ground truth -- the list of steps we anticipate the agent should take.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n// Trajectory evaluation will compare\\nexpected_steps = [\"determine_intent\", \"use_tool\", \"review_results\", \"report_generation\"]\\nactual_steps = [\"determine_intent\", \"use_tool\", \"review_results\", \"report_generation\"]\\n\\nSeveral ground-truth-based trajectory evaluations exist:\\n\\nExact match: Requires a perfect match to the ideal trajectory.\\n\\nIn-order match: Requires the correct actions in the correct order, allows for extra actions.\\n\\nAny-order match: Requires the correct actions in any order, allows for extra actions.\\n\\nPrecision: Measures the relevance/correctness of predicted actions.\\n\\nRecall: Measures how many essential actions are captured in the prediction.'),\n",

While conceptually similar, they differ in the amount of data they can process, which typically dictates the appropriate use case for each.\\n\\nFirst approach: Using a test file¶\\n\\nThis approach involves creating individual test files, each representing a single, simple agent-model interaction (a session). It's most effective during active agent development, serving as a form of unit testing. These tests are designed for rapid execution and should focus on simple session complexity. Each test file contains a single session, which may consist of multiple turns. A turn represents a single interaction between the user and the agent.

It is situated after the \"How Events Flow\" section, leading into advanced topics and practical advice for working with events in ADK applications.\\n\\nThe underlying SessionService determines how these prefixes are handled for persistence.\\n\\nError Events:\\n\\nAn Event can represent an error. Check the event.error_code and event.error_message fields (inherited from LlmResponse).\\n\\nErrors might originate from the LLM (e.g., safety filters, resource limits) or potentially be packaged by the framework if a tool fails critically. Check tool FunctionResponse content for typical tool-specific errors.\\n\\n// Example Error Event (conceptual)\\n{\\n  \"author\": \"LLMAgent\",\\n  \"invocation_id\": \"e-err...\",\\n  \"content\": null,\\n  \"error_code\": \"SAFETY_FILTER_TRIGGERED\",\\n  \"error_message\": \"Response blocked due to safety settings.\",\\n  \"actions\": {}\\n}\\n\\nThese details provide a more complete picture for advanced use cases involving tool authentication, state persistence scope, and error handling within the event stream.\\n\\nBest Practices for Working with Events¶\\n\\nTo use events effectively in your ADK applications:\\n\\nClear Authorship: When building custom agents (BaseAgent), ensure yield Event(author=self.name, ...) to correctly attribute agent actions in the history. The framework generally handles authorship correctly for LLM/tool events.\\n\\nSemantic Content & Actions: Use event.content for the core message/data (text, function call/response). Use event.actions specifically for signaling side effects (state/artifact deltas) or control flow (transfer, escalate, skip_summarization).'),\n",

While ADK services aim for consistency, consider potential downstream effects if your application logic re-processes events.\\n\\nUse is_final_response(): Rely on this helper method in your application/UI layer to identify complete, user-facing text responses. Avoid manually replicating its logic.\\n\\nLeverage History: The session.events list is your primary debugging tool. Examine the sequence of authors, content, and actions to trace execution and diagnose issues.\\n\\nUse Metadata: Use invocation_id to correlate all events within a single user interaction. Use event.id to reference specific, unique occurrences.\\n\\nTreating events as structured messages with clear purposes for their content and actions is key to building, debugging, and managing complex agent behaviors in ADK.'),\n",

ADK supports integrating custom functions (FunctionTool), using other agents as tools (AgentTool), leveraging built-in functionalities like code execution, and interacting with external data sources and APIs (e.g., Search, Databases). Support for long-running tools allows handling asynchronous operations effectively.\\n\\nFlexible Orchestration: Define complex agent workflows using built-in workflow agents (SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, LoopAgent) alongside LLM-driven dynamic routing. This allows for both predictable pipelines and adaptive agent behavior.\\n\\nIntegrated Developer Tooling: Develop and iterate locally with ease.

I\\'ve got this chunk of code that sets up a FastAPI web app with WebSocket endpoints. Let me break it down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I see that the code imports necessary modules like FastAPI, WebSocket, and Path. It then creates a FastAPI app instance and mounts a static directory. The root endpoint serves an index.html file from the static directory. That makes sense because the frontend needs an HTML file to interact with the WebSocket.\\n\\nNext, there\\'s a WebSocket endpoint at \"/ws/{session_id}\". When a client connects, it accepts the connection and prints a message. Then, it starts an agent session using start_agent_session, which I assume initializes the agent and sets up a live request queue for real-time communication.\\n\\nThe code then creates two asynchronous tasks: one for sending messages from the agent to the client and another for receiving messages from the client to the agent. These tasks are run concurrently using asyncio.gather. This setup allows bidirectional communication, which is essential for a real-time chat application.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused about how the agent session is started. The function start_agent_session returns live_events and live_request_queue. I think live_events are the stream of responses from the agent, and live_request_queue handles incoming user messages. The agent_to_client_messaging function sends these events to the WebSocket, and client_to_agent_messaging sends user input back to the agent.\\n\\nI also notice that the WebSocket connection is managed within the endpoint. When the client disconnects, the tasks are stopped, and a disconnection message is printed. This ensures resources are cleaned up properly.\\n\\nTo use this, I\\'d need to have the agent defined in another file, probably agent.py, which is imported here. The .env file should have the necessary API keys for Gemini. The static directory should contain the index.html file that connects to this WebSocket endpoint.\\n\\nI\\'m wondering how the frontend (index.html) interacts with this backend. The HTML file must have JavaScript that connects to the WebSocket at \"/ws/{session_id}\" and handles sending and receiving messages. The backend then routes these messages through the agent.\\n\\nI should also consider error handling. What if the agent doesn\\'t respond? Or if there\\'s a network issue? The current code doesn\\'t show any error handling, so that might be something to add for a production environment.\\n\\nAnother thing is security. Since this is a real-time application, ensuring that the WebSocket connection is secure (using wss://) and that only authorized clients can connect is important. Maybe implementing some form of authentication for the WebSocket endpoint would be necessary.\\n\\nI\\'m also curious about scalability. If many clients connect at the same time, will the server handle it? FastAPI is asynchronous, so it should handle multiple connections efficiently, but I might need to test it under load.\\n\\nOverall, this code sets up a basic but functional real-time chat application using ADK Streaming and FastAPI. It demonstrates how to integrate an AI agent into a web app with bidirectional communication. To make it production-ready, I\\'d need to add error handling, security measures, and possibly some form of logging for monitoring.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe provided code snippet is part of a section that demonstrates how to build a custom streaming application using FastAPI and ADK Streaming.

I remember reading something about using a local server with the adk api_server command. Let me see if I can recall the steps.\\n\\nFirst, I need to make sure I\\'m in the correct directory. The document mentioned that the structure should have a parent folder with my agent\\'s folder inside it, containing __init__.py, .env, and agent.py. So I should check where I am in the terminal and navigate to that parent folder if I\\'m not already there.\\n\\nOnce I\\'m in the right directory, I can run the command adk api_server. This should start a FastAPI server locally. I remember the output had some INFO lines about the server starting and being available at http://0.0.0.0:8000. I should wait until it says \"Application startup complete\" to make sure it\\'s ready.\\n\\nAfter the server is running, I need to create a new session. The document showed a curl command for that. It was a POST request to a URL that includes the app name, user ID, and session ID. The JSON data included a state with some key-value pairs. I think the state is optional, so I can leave it out if I don\\'t need it, but including it might help in testing.\\n\\nI should open a new terminal tab to run the curl command without stopping the server. The example used my_sample_agent, u_123, and s_123. I can replace these with my own values, but I need to make sure they\\'re unique to avoid conflicts. If I get an error that the session already exists, I\\'ll have to delete the old one or choose a different session ID.\\n\\nNow, after creating the session, I want to send a query to my agent. There are two endpoints mentioned: /run and /run_sse. The /run endpoint collects all events and returns them at once, which is recommended for most users. The /run_sse endpoint streams events as they happen, which might be better for real-time applications.\\n\\nI\\'ll try using the /run endpoint first. The curl command for this includes the app_name, user_id, session_id, and a new_message. The new_message has a role and parts, which in the example was a text message asking about the weather. I need to structure my JSON correctly, making sure the syntax is right to avoid errors.\\n\\nWhen I send the POST request, I should get a response that\\'s a list of events. These events might include function calls, responses, and the final message. I can parse this response to see if my agent handled the query correctly.\\n\\nIf I want to use streaming, I can try the /run_sse endpoint. The curl command is similar, but with an additional parameter \"streaming\": true. This should give me each event as it happens, which could be useful for debugging or applications that need immediate updates.\\n\\nI also remember reading about integrations with tools like Comet Opik for observability. Maybe after testing locally, I can look into setting that up to monitor my agent\\'s performance.\\n\\nFinally, once I\\'m confident my agent works as expected, I can deploy it using options like Agent Engine or Cloud Run. But for now, focusing on local testing is my priority to ensure everything is functioning correctly before deployment.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo test your agent locally, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Launch the Local Server**: Navigate to the parent directory of your agent folder and run `adk api_server` to start the FastAPI server. Wait for the server to start successfully.\\n\\n2. **Create a New Session**: Open a new terminal and use a curl command to create a session. Replace the placeholders with your agent name, user ID, and session ID. Optionally, include a state in the JSON data.\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/apps/your_agent_name/users/your_user_id/sessions/your_session_id \\\\\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n   -d \\'{\"state\": {\"key\": \"value\"}}\\'\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Send a Query Using /run**:\\n   - Use the following curl command to send a query to your agent. This endpoint collects all events and returns them at once.\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run \\\\\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n     -d \\'{\\n         \"app_name\": \"your_agent_name\",\\n         \"user_id\": \"your_user_id\",\\n         \"session_id\": \"your_session_id\",\\n         \"new_message\": {\\n             \"role\": \"user\",\\n             \"parts\": [{\\n                 \"text\": \"Your query text here\"\\n             }]\\n         }\\n     }\\'\\n     ```\\n\\n   - **Response**: You will receive a list of events, including function calls, responses, and the final message.\\n\\n4. **Optional: Use /run_sse for Streaming**:\\n   - For real-time streaming, use the /run_sse endpoint with the streaming parameter set to true.\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run_sse \\\\\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n     -d \\'{\\n         \"app_name\": \"your_agent_name\",\\n         \"user_id\": \"your_user_id\",\\n         \"session_id\": \"your_session_id\",\\n         \"new_message\": {\\n             \"role\": \"user\",\\n             \"parts\": [{\\n                 \"text\": \"Your query text here\"\\n             }]\\n         },\\n         \"streaming\": true\\n     }\\'\\n     ```\\n\\n   - **Response**: Events will be streamed as they occur, useful for immediate updates.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can thoroughly test your agent\\'s functionality and ensure it behaves as expected before moving on to deployment.'}, page_content='<think>\\nOkay, so I\\'m trying to figure out how to test my agent before deploying it.

I need to structure my JSON correctly, making sure the syntax is right to avoid errors.\\n\\nWhen I send the POST request, I should get a response that\\'s a list of events. These events might include function calls, responses, and the final message. I can parse this response to see if my agent handled the query correctly.\\n\\nIf I want to use streaming, I can try the /run_sse endpoint. The curl command is similar, but with an additional parameter \"streaming\": true. This should give me each event as it happens, which could be useful for debugging or applications that need immediate updates.\\n\\nI also remember reading about integrations with tools like Comet Opik for observability. Maybe after testing locally, I can look into setting that up to monitor my agent\\'s performance.\\n\\nFinally, once I\\'m confident my agent works as expected, I can deploy it using options like Agent Engine or Cloud Run. But for now, focusing on local testing is my priority to ensure everything is functioning correctly before deployment.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo test your agent locally, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Launch the Local Server**: Navigate to the parent directory of your agent folder and run `adk api_server` to start the FastAPI server. Wait for the server to start successfully.\\n\\n2. **Create a New Session**: Open a new terminal and use a curl command to create a session. Replace the placeholders with your agent name, user ID, and session ID. Optionally, include a state in the JSON data.\\n\\n   ```bash\\n   curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/apps/your_agent_name/users/your_user_id/sessions/your_session_id \\\\\\n   -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n   -d \\'{\"state\": {\"key\": \"value\"}}\\'\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Send a Query Using /run**:\\n   - Use the following curl command to send a query to your agent. This endpoint collects all events and returns them at once.\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run \\\\\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n     -d \\'{\\n         \"app_name\": \"your_agent_name\",\\n         \"user_id\": \"your_user_id\",\\n         \"session_id\": \"your_session_id\",\\n         \"new_message\": {\\n             \"role\": \"user\",\\n             \"parts\": [{\\n                 \"text\": \"Your query text here\"\\n             }]\\n         }\\n     }\\'\\n     ```\\n\\n   - **Response**: You will receive a list of events, including function calls, responses, and the final message.\\n\\n4. **Optional: Use /run_sse for Streaming**:\\n   - For real-time streaming, use the /run_sse endpoint with the streaming parameter set to true.\\n\\n     ```bash\\n     curl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run_sse \\\\\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n     -d \\'{\\n         \"app_name\": \"your_agent_name\",\\n         \"user_id\": \"your_user_id\",\\n         \"session_id\": \"your_session_id\",\\n         \"new_message\": {\\n             \"role\": \"user\",\\n             \"parts\": [{\\n                 \"text\": \"Your query text here\"\\n             }]\\n         },\\n         \"streaming\": true\\n     }\\'\\n     ```\\n\\n   - **Response**: Events will be streamed as they occur, useful for immediate updates.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you can thoroughly test your agent\\'s functionality and ensure it behaves as expected before moving on to deployment.\\n\\nSend a query\\n\\nThere are two ways to send queries via POST to your agent, via the /run or /run_sse routes.\\n\\nPOST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run: collects all events as a list and returns the list all at once. Suitable for most users (if you are unsure, we recommend using this one).\\n\\nPOST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run_sse: returns as Server-Sent-Events, which is a stream of event objects. Suitable for those who want to be notified as soon as the event is available. With /run_sse, you can also set streaming to true to enable token-level streaming.\\n\\nUsing /run\\n\\ncurl -X POST http://0.0.0.0:8000/run \\\\\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\\\\n-d \\'{\\n\"app_name\": \"my_sample_agent\",\\n\"user_id\": \"u_123\",\\n\"session_id\": \"s_123\",\\n\"new_message\": {\\n    \"role\": \"user\",\\n    \"parts\": [{\\n    \"text\": \"Hey whats the weather in new york today\"\\n    }]\\n}\\n}\\'\\n\\nIf using /run, you will see the full output of events at the same time, as a list, which should appear similar to:'),\n",

Different tools in the same agent can be configured with different strategies, so care is needed when talking about the agent's configurations.\\n\\nAgent-Auth¶\\n\\nThe tool interacts with external systems using the agent's own identity (e.g., a service account). The agent identity must be explicitly authorized in the external system access policies, like adding an agent's service account to a database's IAM policy for read access. Such policies constrain the agent in only performing actions that the developer intended as possible: by giving read-only permissions to a resource, no matter what the model decides, the tool will be prohibited from performing write actions.\\n\\nThis approach is simple to implement, and it is appropriate for agents where all users share the same level of access. If not all users have the same level of access, such an approach alone doesn't provide enough protection and must be complemented with other techniques below. In tool implementation, ensure that logs are created to maintain attribution of actions to users, as all agents' actions will appear as coming from the agent.\\n\\nUser Auth¶\"),\n",

This chunk specifically explains \"User Auth\" and \"Guardrails to screen inputs and outputs\" as part of the best practices to ensure secure AI agent operations.\\n\\nUser Auth¶\\n\\nThe tool interacts with an external system using the identity of the \"controlling user\" (e.g., the human interacting with the frontend in a web application). In ADK, this is typically implemented using OAuth: the agent interacts with the frontend to acquire a OAuth token, and then the tool uses the token when performing external actions: the external system authorizes the action if the controlling user is authorized to perform it on its own.\\n\\nUser auth has the advantage that agents only perform actions that the user could have performed themselves. This greatly reduces the risk that a malicious user could abuse the agent to obtain access to additional data. However, most common implementations of delegation have a fixed set permissions to delegate (i.e., OAuth scopes). Often, such scopes are broader than the access that the agent actually requires, and the techniques below are required to further constrain agent actions.\\n\\nGuardrails to screen inputs and outputs¶\\n\\nIn-tool guardrails¶\\n\\nTools can be designed with security in mind: we can create tools that expose the actions we want the model to take and nothing else. By limiting the range of actions we provide to the agents, we can deterministically eliminate classes of rogue actions that we never want the agent to take.\\n\\nIn-tool guardrails is an approach to create common and re-usable tools that expose deterministic controls that can be used by developers to set limits on each tool instantiation.'),\n",

Agents Use Tools¶\\n\\nAgents leverage tools dynamically through mechanisms often involving function calling. The process generally follows these steps:\\n\\nReasoning: The agent's LLM analyzes its system instruction, conversation history, and user request.\\n\\nSelection: Based on the analysis, the LLM decides on which tool, if any, to execute, based on the tools available to the agent and the docstrings that describes each tool.\\n\\nInvocation: The LLM generates the required arguments (inputs) for the selected tool and triggers its execution.\\n\\nObservation: The agent receives the output (result) returned by the tool.\\n\\nFinalization: The agent incorporates the tool's output into its ongoing reasoning process to formulate the next response, decide the subsequent step, or determine if the goal has been achieved.\\n\\nThink of the tools as a specialized toolkit that the agent's intelligent core (the LLM) can access and utilize as needed to accomplish complex tasks.\\n\\nTool Types in ADK¶\\n\\nADK offers flexibility by supporting several types of tools:\\n\\nFunction Tools: Tools created by you, tailored to your specific application's needs.\\n\\nFunctions/Methods: Define standard synchronous functions or methods in your code (e.g., Python def).\\n\\nAgents-as-Tools: Use another, potentially specialized, agent as a tool for a parent agent.\\n\\nLong Running Function Tools: Support for tools that perform asynchronous operations or take significant time to complete.\"),\n",

Examples: Google Search, Code Execution, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).\\n\\nThird-Party Tools: Integrate tools seamlessly from popular external libraries. Examples: LangChain Tools, CrewAI Tools.\\n\\nNavigate to the respective documentation pages linked above for detailed information and examples for each tool type.\\n\\nReferencing Tool in Agent’s Instructions¶\\n\\nWithin an agent's instructions, you can directly reference a tool by using its function name. If the tool's function name and docstring are sufficiently descriptive, your instructions can primarily focus on when the Large Language Model (LLM) should utilize the tool. This promotes clarity and helps the model understand the intended use of each tool.\\n\\nIt is crucial to clearly instruct the agent on how to handle different return values that a tool might produce. For example, if a tool returns an error message, your instructions should specify whether the agent should retry the operation, give up on the task, or request additional information from the user.\"),\n",

This signals the framework to start an authentication flow based on the provided auth_config.\\n\\nget_auth_response(): Call this in a subsequent invocation (after request_credential was successfully handled) to retrieve the credentials the user provided.\\n\\nFor detailed explanations of authentication flows, configuration, and examples, please refer to the dedicated Tool Authentication documentation page.\\n\\nContext-Aware Data Access Methods¶\"),\n",

Artifacts are typically files (images, documents, etc.) uploaded by the user or generated by tools/agents.\\n\\nload_artifact(filename: str): Retrieves a specific artifact by its filename from the artifact_service. You can optionally specify a version; if omitted, the latest version is returned. Returns a google.genai.types.Part object containing the artifact data and mime type, or None if not found.\\n\\nsave_artifact(filename: str, artifact: types.Part): Saves a new version of an artifact to the artifact_service. Returns the new version number (starting from 0).\\n\\nsearch_memory(query: str): Queries the user's long-term memory using the configured memory_service.

This is essential for ADK to generate the correct schema for the LLM.\\n\\nEnsure all parameter types are JSON serializable. Standard Python types like str, int, float, bool, list, dict, and their combinations are generally safe. Avoid complex custom class instances as direct parameters unless they have a clear JSON representation.\\n\\nDo not set default values for parameters. E.g., def my_func(param1: str = \"default\"). Default values are not reliably supported or used by the underlying models during function call generation.

ADK provides a system to handle various authentication methods securely.\\n\\nThe key components involved are:\\n\\nAuthScheme: Defines how an API expects authentication credentials (e.g., as an API Key in a header, an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token). ADK supports the same types of authentication schemes as OpenAPI 3.0. To know more about what each type of credential is, refer to OpenAPI doc: Authentication. ADK uses specific classes like APIKey, HTTPBearer, OAuth2, OpenIdConnectWithConfig.\\n\\nAuthCredential: Holds the initial information needed to start the authentication process (e.g., your application's OAuth Client ID/Secret, an API key value). It includes an auth_type (like API_KEY, OAUTH2, SERVICE_ACCOUNT) specifying the credential type.\\n\\nThe general flow involves providing these details when configuring a tool. ADK then attempts to automatically exchange the initial credential for a usable one (like an access token) before the tool makes an API call. For flows requiring user interaction (like OAuth consent), a specific interactive process involving the Agent Client application is triggered.\\n\\nSupported Initial Credential Types¶\\n\\nAPI_KEY: For simple key/value authentication.

This event signals that user interaction is needed. Use helper functions to identify this event and extract necessary information.\\n\\n# runner = Runner(...)\\n# session = session_service.create_session(...)\\n# content = types.Content(...) # User\\'s initial query\\n\\nprint(\"\\\\nRunning agent...\")\\nevents_async = runner.run_async(\\n    session_id=session.id, user_id=\\'user\\', new_message=content\\n)\\n\\nauth_request_event_id, auth_config = None, None'),\n",

This allows for tailored functionality, such as connecting to proprietary databases or implementing unique algorithms.\\n\\nFor example, a function tool, \"myfinancetool\", might be a function that calculates a specific financial metric.

Function Tool¶\\n\\nTransforming a function into a tool is a straightforward way to integrate custom logic into your agents. This approach offers flexibility and quick integration.\\n\\nParameters¶\\n\\nDefine your function parameters using standard JSON-serializable types (e.g., string, integer, list, dictionary). It\\'s important to avoid setting default values for parameters, as the language model (LLM) does not currently support interpreting them.\\n\\nReturn Type¶\\n\\nThe preferred return type for a Python Function Tool is a dictionary. This allows you to structure the response with key-value pairs, providing context and clarity to the LLM. If your function returns a type other than a dictionary, the framework automatically wraps it into a dictionary with a single key named \"result\".'),\n",

For example, instead of returning a numeric error code, return a dictionary with an \"error_message\" key containing a human-readable explanation. Remember that the LLM, not a piece of code, needs to understand the result. As a best practice, include a \"status\" key in your return dictionary to indicate the overall outcome (e.g., \"success\", \"error\", \"pending\"), providing the LLM with a clear signal about the operation\\'s state.\\n\\nDocstring¶\\n\\nThe docstring of your function serves as the tool\\'s description and is sent to the LLM. Therefore, a well-written and comprehensive docstring is crucial for the LLM to understand how to use the tool effectively. Clearly explain the purpose of the function, the meaning of its parameters, and the expected return values.\\n\\nBest Practices¶\\n\\nWhile you have considerable flexibility in defining your function, remember that simplicity enhances usability for the LLM. Consider these guidelines:\\n\\nFewer Parameters are Better: Minimize the number of parameters to reduce complexity.\\n\\nSimple Data Types: Favor primitive data types like str and int over custom classes whenever possible.\\n\\nMeaningful Names: The function\\'s name and parameter names significantly influence how the LLM interprets and utilizes the tool. Choose names that clearly reflect the function\\'s purpose and the meaning of its inputs. Avoid generic names like do_stuff().\\n\\n2. Long Running Function Tool¶'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'adk_documentation_website_data/adk-docs_tools_function-tools.html', 'source_path': 'adk_documentation_website_data/adk-docs_tools_function-tools.html', 'context_summary': '<think>\\nOkay, so I\\'m trying to understand how to use function tools in ADK, especially the Long Running Function Tool. From the document, I see that function tools allow developers to create custom functionality beyond what\\'s available out of the box. The first part talks about Function Tools in general, which can be transformed into tools by integrating custom logic. They mention that parameters should be JSON-serializable and that the return type is preferably a dictionary with a \"status\" key. The docstring is important because it\\'s sent to the LLM, so it needs to be clear.\\n\\nNow, the chunk I\\'m focusing on is about the Long Running Function Tool. It\\'s a subclass of FunctionTool and is designed for tasks that take a long time without blocking the agent. The example given is a human-in-the-loop scenario where the agent might need human approval. \\n\\nThe process involves wrapping a generator function with LongRunningFunctionTool. When the LLM calls the tool, the generator starts executing. It can yield intermediate results as dictionaries to update the model and user. The ADK framework sends these as FunctionResponse. Once done, the generator returns the final result, which is sent as the last FunctionResponse.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused about how the generator function works. It uses yield to send intermediate updates, but how does the framework handle these? Does it send each yield as a separate response? Also, how does the agent continue with other tasks while the long-running function is executing? Is the function running in a separate thread or process?\\n\\nAnother point is the return type. The generator can return a final result, which is then wrapped into a FunctionResponse. But if the function yields multiple times, how does the LLM know when the process is complete? It must be when the generator finishes and returns the final value.\\n\\nI\\'m also thinking about how to structure the intermediate updates. The example uses dictionaries with \"status\" and \"message\". Should these always include specific keys, or can they be customized? It seems like including \"status\" is important for the LLM to understand the state.\\n\\nI\\'m wondering about error handling. If the generator raises an exception, how is that handled? Does the framework catch it and send an error response, or does it propagate up? The document doesn\\'t mention this, so I might need to look into error handling separately.\\n\\nAdditionally, the document mentions that the function\\'s name and parameter names are important for the LLM. So when creating a LongRunningFunctionTool, I should choose clear, descriptive names to make it easier for the LLM to understand how to use the tool.\\n\\nI\\'m also curious about the difference between LongRunningFunctionTool and Agent-as-a-Tool. The latter allows calling another agent as a tool, which seems useful for delegating tasks. But in this case, I\\'m focusing on the function tool, so I\\'ll set that aside for now.\\n\\nTo summarize, the key points are:\\n1. Use a generator function with yield for intermediate updates.\\n2. Wrap it with LongRunningFunctionTool.\\n3. Ensure the function name and parameters are descriptive.\\n4. Use dictionaries for returns, including a \"status\" key.\\n5. The framework handles sending each yield as a FunctionResponse and the final return as the last response.\\n\\nI think I need to write a sample generator function, wrap it with LongRunningFunctionTool, and test how the intermediate and final responses are handled by the agent and LLM. This hands-on approach will help solidify my understanding.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe Long Running Function Tool in ADK is designed to handle tasks that require extended processing without blocking agent execution. It involves wrapping a generator function with `LongRunningFunctionTool`, allowing the function to yield intermediate updates as dictionaries.

From the document, I see that function tools allow developers to create custom functionality beyond what\\'s available out of the box. The first part talks about Function Tools in general, which can be transformed into tools by integrating custom logic. They mention that parameters should be JSON-serializable and that the return type is preferably a dictionary with a \"status\" key. The docstring is important because it\\'s sent to the LLM, so it needs to be clear.\\n\\nNow, the chunk I\\'m focusing on is about the Long Running Function Tool. It\\'s a subclass of FunctionTool and is designed for tasks that take a long time without blocking the agent. The example given is a human-in-the-loop scenario where the agent might need human approval. \\n\\nThe process involves wrapping a generator function with LongRunningFunctionTool. When the LLM calls the tool, the generator starts executing. It can yield intermediate results as dictionaries to update the model and user. The ADK framework sends these as FunctionResponse. Once done, the generator returns the final result, which is sent as the last FunctionResponse.\\n\\nI\\'m a bit confused about how the generator function works. It uses yield to send intermediate updates, but how does the framework handle these? Does it send each yield as a separate response? Also, how does the agent continue with other tasks while the long-running function is executing? Is the function running in a separate thread or process?\\n\\nAnother point is the return type. The generator can return a final result, which is then wrapped into a FunctionResponse. But if the function yields multiple times, how does the LLM know when the process is complete? It must be when the generator finishes and returns the final value.\\n\\nI\\'m also thinking about how to structure the intermediate updates. The example uses dictionaries with \"status\" and \"message\". Should these always include specific keys, or can they be customized? It seems like including \"status\" is important for the LLM to understand the state.\\n\\nI\\'m wondering about error handling. If the generator raises an exception, how is that handled? Does the framework catch it and send an error response, or does it propagate up? The document doesn\\'t mention this, so I might need to look into error handling separately.\\n\\nAdditionally, the document mentions that the function\\'s name and parameter names are important for the LLM. So when creating a LongRunningFunctionTool, I should choose clear, descriptive names to make it easier for the LLM to understand how to use the tool.\\n\\nI\\'m also curious about the difference between LongRunningFunctionTool and Agent-as-a-Tool. The latter allows calling another agent as a tool, which seems useful for delegating tasks. But in this case, I\\'m focusing on the function tool, so I\\'ll set that aside for now.\\n\\nTo summarize, the key points are:\\n1. Use a generator function with yield for intermediate updates.\\n2. Wrap it with LongRunningFunctionTool.\\n3. Ensure the function name and parameters are descriptive.\\n4. Use dictionaries for returns, including a \"status\" key.\\n5. The framework handles sending each yield as a FunctionResponse and the final return as the last response.\\n\\nI think I need to write a sample generator function, wrap it with LongRunningFunctionTool, and test how the intermediate and final responses are handled by the agent and LLM. This hands-on approach will help solidify my understanding.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe Long Running Function Tool in ADK is designed to handle tasks that require extended processing without blocking agent execution. It involves wrapping a generator function with `LongRunningFunctionTool`, allowing the function to yield intermediate updates as dictionaries. These updates are sent as `FunctionResponse` objects by the framework, keeping the model and user informed. The generator function ultimately returns a final result, which is sent as the concluding response. Key considerations include using clear function and parameter names, structuring returns with a \"status\" key, and understanding that the framework manages threading to allow the agent to handle other tasks concurrently.\\n\\nMeaningful Names: The function\\'s name and parameter names significantly influence how the LLM interprets and utilizes the tool. Choose names that clearly reflect the function\\'s purpose and the meaning of its inputs. Avoid generic names like do_stuff().\\n\\n2. Long Running Function Tool¶\\n\\nDesigned for tasks that require a significant amount of processing time without blocking the agent\\'s execution. This tool is a subclass of FunctionTool.\\n\\nWhen using a LongRunningFunctionTool, your Python function can initiate the long-running operation and optionally return an intermediate result to keep the model and user informed about the progress. The agent can then continue with other tasks. An example is the human-in-the-loop scenario where the agent needs human approval before proceeding with a task.\\n\\nHow it Works¶\\n\\nYou wrap a Python generator function (a function using yield) with LongRunningFunctionTool.\\n\\nInitiation: When the LLM calls the tool, your generator function starts executing.\\n\\nIntermediate Updates (yield): Your function should yield intermediate Python objects (typically dictionaries) periodically to report progress. The ADK framework takes each yielded value and sends it back to the LLM packaged within a FunctionResponse. This allows the LLM to inform the user (e.g., status, percentage complete, messages).\\n\\nCompletion (return): When the task is finished, the generator function uses return to provide the final Python object result.'),\n",

It sends each yielded value back as an intermediate FunctionResponse. When the generator completes, the framework sends the returned value as the content of the final FunctionResponse, signaling the end of the long-running operation to the LLM.\\n\\nCreating the Tool¶\\n\\nDefine your generator function and wrap it using the LongRunningFunctionTool class:\\n\\nfrom google.adk.tools import LongRunningFunctionTool\\n\\n# Define your generator function (see example below)\\ndef my_long_task_generator(*args, **kwargs):\\n    # ... setup ...\\n    yield {\"status\": \"pending\", \"message\": \"Starting task...\"} # Framework sends this as FunctionResponse\\n    # ... perform work incrementally ...\\n    yield {\"status\": \"pending\", \"progress\": 50}               # Framework sends this as FunctionResponse\\n    # ... finish work ...\\n    return {\"status\": \"completed\", \"result\": \"Final outcome\"} # Framework sends this as final FunctionResponse\\n\\n# Wrap the function\\nmy_tool = LongRunningFunctionTool(func=my_long_task_generator)\\n\\nIntermediate Updates¶\\n\\nYielding structured Python objects (like dictionaries) is crucial for providing meaningful updates.

The example shows how to create the toolset with a JSON string or a dictionary, get the tools, and add them to the LlmAgent.\\n\\nSo, the chunk is part of the overall document that explains the process from obtaining the spec to integrating the tools into the agent. It\\'s specifically about the usage workflow, which is a practical guide on how to implement the integration.\\n\\nI think the context is about the steps needed to integrate an OpenAPI spec into an agent, focusing on initializing the toolset, retrieving the generated tools, and adding them to the agent. This helps in understanding how to use the OpenAPIToolset to generate the necessary tools and integrate them into the agent\\'s workflow.\\n\\nI should make sure the context clearly states that this chunk is part of the usage workflow, detailing the steps from obtaining the spec to adding the tools to the agent. That way, someone searching for how to integrate an OpenAPI spec would find this chunk easily.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe chunk provides a step-by-step guide on integrating an OpenAPI specification into an agent, covering obtaining the spec, initializing the OpenAPIToolset, retrieving generated tools, and adding them to the agent.\\n\\nResponse Handling: Returns the API response (typically JSON) back to the agent flow.\\n\\nAuthentication: You can configure global authentication (like API keys or OAuth - see Authentication for details) when initializing OpenAPIToolset. This authentication configuration is automatically applied to all generated RestApiTool instances.\\n\\nUsage Workflow¶\\n\\nFollow these steps to integrate an OpenAPI spec into your agent:\\n\\nObtain Spec: Get your OpenAPI specification document (e.g., load from a .json or .yaml file, fetch from a URL).\\n\\nInstantiate Toolset: Create an OpenAPIToolset instance, passing the spec content and type (spec_str/spec_dict, spec_str_type).

The tool descriptions generated from the spec will also help the LLM.\\n\\nRun Agent: Execute your agent using the Runner.

This approach is shown because it gives you fine-grained control over the agent\\'s execution lifecycle, session management, and state persistence.\\n\\nAlternative: Using ADK\\'s Built-in Tools (Web UI / CLI / API Server)\\n\\nIf you prefer a setup that handles the runner and session management automatically using ADK\\'s standard tools, you can find the equivalent code structured for that purpose here. That version is designed to be run directly with commands like adk web (for a web UI), adk run (for CLI interaction), or adk api_server (to expose an API).

This involves creating two core pieces:\\n\\nA Tool: A Python function that equips the agent with the ability to fetch weather data.\\n\\nAn Agent: The AI \"brain\" that understands the user\\'s request, knows it has a weather tool, and decides when and how to use it.\\n\\n1. Define the Tool (get_weather)\\n\\nIn ADK, Tools are the building blocks that give agents concrete capabilities beyond just text generation. They are typically regular Python functions that perform specific actions, like calling an API, querying a database, or performing calculations.\\n\\nOur first tool will provide a mock weather report. This allows us to focus on the agent structure without needing external API keys yet. Later, you could easily swap this mock function with one that calls a real weather service.\\n\\nKey Concept: Docstrings are Crucial!

When the root agent receives a user query, its LLM considers not only its own instructions and tools but also the description of each sub-agent. If the LLM determines that a query aligns better with a sub-agent\\'s described capability (e.g., \"Handles simple greetings\"), it will automatically generate a special internal action to transfer control to that sub-agent for that turn. The sub-agent then processes the query using its own model, instructions, and tools.\\n\\nBest Practice: Ensure the root agent\\'s instructions clearly guide its delegation decisions.

To create more sophisticated and context-aware experiences, agents need memory. ADK provides this through Session State.\\n\\nWhat is Session State?\\n\\nIt\\'s a Python dictionary (session.state) tied to a specific user session (identified by APP_NAME, USER_ID, SESSION_ID).\\n\\nIt persists information across multiple conversational turns within that session.'),\n",

This foundational understanding of state management is key as we proceed to implement safety guardrails using callbacks in the next steps.\\n\\nStep 5: Adding Safety - Input Guardrail with before_model_callback¶\\n\\nOur agent team is becoming more capable, remembering preferences and using tools effectively. However, in real-world scenarios, we often need safety mechanisms to control the agent\\'s behavior before potentially problematic requests even reach the core Large Language Model (LLM).\\n\\nADK provides Callbacks – functions that allow you to hook into specific points in the agent\\'s execution lifecycle. The before_model_callback is particularly useful for input safety.\\n\\nWhat is before_model_callback?\\n\\nIt\\'s a Python function you define that ADK executes just before an agent sends its compiled request (including conversation history, instructions, and the latest user message) to the underlying LLM.\\n\\nPurpose: Inspect the request, modify it if necessary, or block it entirely based on predefined rules.\\n\\nCommon Use Cases:\\n\\nInput Validation/Filtering: Check if user input meets criteria or contains disallowed content (like PII or keywords).'),\n",

Could you add a \"forecast\" agent?\\n\\nAdvanced Callbacks:\\n\\nUse after_model_callback to potentially reformat or sanitize the LLM\\'s response after it\\'s generated.\\n\\nUse after_tool_callback to process or log the results returned by a tool.\\n\\nImplement before_agent_callback or after_agent_callback for agent-level entry/exit logic.\\n\\nError Handling: Improve how the agent handles tool errors or unexpected API responses. Maybe add retry logic within a tool.\\n\\nPersistent Session Storage: Explore alternatives to InMemorySessionService for storing session state persistently (e.g., using databases like Firestore or Cloud SQL – requires custom implementation or future ADK integrations).'),\n",

      "Based on the documentation, here's how you can create a custom agent using the Agent Development Kit (ADK):\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Understand the Need for Customization:** Custom agents are useful when you need conditional logic or branching based on the outcome of sub-agent tasks, which isn't available in standard workflow agents. The `StoryFlowAgent` example in the documentation shows a scenario where the story is regenerated if the tone check fails.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Define Your Custom Agent Class:** Inherit from `BaseAgent` to create your custom agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    from google_adk.core.agent import BaseAgent\n",
      "    from google_adk.core.llm.llm_agent import LlmAgent  # Import other agent types as needed\n",
      "\n",
      "    class StoryFlowAgent(BaseAgent):\n",
      "        \"\"\"\n",
      "        Custom agent for a story generation and refinement workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "        This agent orchestrates a sequence of LLM agents to generate a story,\n",
      "        critique it, revise it, check grammar and tone, and potentially\n",
      "        regenerate the story if the tone is negative.\n",

      "*   **Import Necessary Modules:** Import `BaseAgent`, `LlmAgent`, and other relevant classes from `google_adk.core`.\n",
      "*   **Define Agent Logic:** Implement the specific logic for your agent within its methods (not shown in the provided example, but this is where you'd implement the story generation, critique, revision, and conditional regeneration logic).\n"

      "To create a multi-agent system running parallel, you can use the ParallelAgent in the Agent Development Kit (ADK). Here's a step-by-step guide:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Create a new project structure**: Create a new folder for your project, and inside it, create another folder for your agent. For example, `parent_folder/multi_agent_system/`.\n",

      "3. **Create an `agent.py` file**: In the same folder, create an `agent.py` file where you'll define your agents.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Define your sub-agents**: In the `agent.py` file, define multiple sub-agents that will run in parallel. These sub-agents can be instances of `BaseAgent` or any other type of agent.\n",

      "5. **Create a ParallelAgent**: Create a `ParallelAgent` instance and pass the list of sub-agents to it.\n",

      "Note that you should use `DatabaseSessionService` instead of `InMemorySessionService` if you want to persist the session state to a database.\n",
